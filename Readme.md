This a small Plugin/Gamemode for Spigot Servers which is inspired by Among us and Minecraft Manhunt.

By typing /start the Game begins and the Player are asigned as Crewmate and the Imposter.

The Crewmates Goal is to kill the Imposter or defeat the Ender Dragon and the Imposters Goal is to kill all Crewmates.

The Plugin is compiled for Minecraft Version 1.16, but the source code is available so you can compile it for other Versions.
